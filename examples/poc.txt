# Easiest way to build an LLM chat proof of concept with custom RAG logic: Gradio vs streamlit vs IPywidgets vs LlamaBot vs LangChain.js or others. Preferabloy stay in python.


For building an LLM chat proof of concept with custom RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) logic in Python, Streamlit emerges as the easiest and most suitable option among the frameworks mentioned. Here's a comparison of the key options:

## Streamlit

Streamlit stands out as the best choice for several reasons:

1. **Ease of Use**: Streamlit is known for its simplicity and intuitive API, making it ideal for rapid prototyping[1][10].

2. **Python-native**: It's a Python-based framework, aligning with your preference to stay in Python[1].

3. **RAG Integration**: Streamlit can be easily integrated with LangChain for implementing custom RAG logic[16].

4. **Interactive UI**: It excels in creating interactive dashboards and data-centric applications[3].

5. **Community Support**: Streamlit has a larger community and more extensive documentation compared to some alternatives[3].

## Gradio

While Gradio is also a strong contender, it has some limitations compared to Streamlit for this specific use case:

- More focused on machine learning demos rather than complex applications[10].
- Less customization options compared to Streamlit[3].

## Other Options

- **IPywidgets**: While useful for Jupyter notebooks, it's less suitable for standalone applications.
- **LlamaBot**: Not as widely used or documented as Streamlit or Gradio.
- **LangChain.js**: This is a JavaScript framework, which doesn't align with your preference to stay in Python.

## Building Your Proof of Concept

To build your LLM chat proof of concept with custom RAG logic using Streamlit and LangChain, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up Environment**:
   ```python
   import streamlit as st
   from langchain.llms import OpenAI
   from langchain.chains import ConversationalRetrievalChain
   from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
   ```

2. **Implement RAG Logic**:
   Use LangChain to set up your custom RAG pipeline, including document loading, embedding, and retrieval.

3. **Create Streamlit UI**:
   ```python
   st.title("LLM Chat with Custom RAG")
   user_input = st.text_input("You: ", "")
   if user_input:
       response = your_rag_function(user_input)
       st.write(f'AI: {response}')
   ```

4. **Integrate LLM and RAG**:
   Use LangChain's `ConversationalRetrievalChain` to combine the LLM with your RAG system.

5. **Add Memory**:
   Implement `ConversationBufferMemory` to maintain context across interactions.

This approach allows you to quickly build a functional proof of concept while leveraging the strengths of both Streamlit for UI and LangChain for LLM and RAG integration, all within a Python environment[5][16].
