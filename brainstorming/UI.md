I imagine one friendly unified web UI that will enable all of these use cases. It has access to a hybrid search vector database so we can also filter on key recurring topics, type of document, time period, status, key entities (organisation, stakeholder) as well as search semantically. It should enable making quick persistent custom selections over multiple searches, creating a dynamic results dossier that can then be visualized (timeline/graph) and/or intelligently queried with a Claude LLM with a large RAG context window accessing the assembled result chunks/documents. Without going into code or details, what interface elements should we have to present all of this without being overwhelming to not-too-tech-savvy political users?
