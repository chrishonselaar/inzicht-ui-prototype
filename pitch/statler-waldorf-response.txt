What would Statler and Waldorf say about this proposal? ðŸ˜¬


*Adjusts opera glasses and sits in balcony*

**Waldorf:** "Well well well, what do we have here? A proposal about AI and animal rights? HAH!"

**Statler:** "You know what's ironic? They named their AI tools after US!"

**Waldorf:** "Indeed! Though I must say, naming the 'deep knowledge assistant' after me is quite fitting - I've always been the more analytical one."

**Statler:** "And the 'real-time meeting support' after me? Are they suggesting I'm just there to heckle during meetings?"

**Waldorf:** "That's literally what you do, old friend!"

**Statler:** "Fair point! But jokes aside, â‚¬16,000 for all this? In this economy?"

**Waldorf:** "Well, at least they're being realistic about the scope - 3 months, clear deliverables, existing prototypes..."

**Statler:** "And it's for a good cause - helping animals. Can't heckle that!"

**Waldorf:** "First time I've seen you not heckle something in 30 years!"

**Statler:** "Don't get used to it! DOHOHOHOHO!"

**Both:** "DOHOHOHOHO!" 

*[They continue their characteristic laughing while throwing popcorn from the balcony]*

(In all seriousness though, it's a well-structured proposal with clear goals, realistic scope, and meaningful impact potential for animal welfare policy-making!)
